                        What Is Artificial Intelligence (Ai)?                         

Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence by software-coded heuristics. Nowadays this code is prevalent in everything enterprise and firmware
Nowadays this code is prevalent in everything from cloud-based, enterprise applications to consumer apps and even embedded firmware.
The year 2022 brought AI into the mainstream through widespread familiarity with applications of Generative Pre-Training Transformer.
The ideal characteristic of artificial intelligence is its ability to rationalize and take actions that have the best chance of achieving a specific goal.
Deep learning techniques enable this automatic learning through the absorption of huge amounts of unstructured data such as text, images, or video.
